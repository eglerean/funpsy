This is the README file for the FUNPSY (FUNctional magnetic resonant imaging Phase SYnchronization) 
toolbox, a MATLAB(TM) toolbox that uses phase synchronization to extract functional patterns from 
brain time series.

For an extensive explanation of the method, please refer to the paper:

Glerean, E., Salmi, J., Lahnakoski, J.M., Jääskeläinen, I.P., Sams, M. (2012). Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Phase Synchronization as a Measure of Dynamic Functional Connectivity. Brain connectivity. doi:10.1089/brain.2011.0068


Please install the toolbox from a terminal with:

svn checkout https://funpsy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ funpsy
