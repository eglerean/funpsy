This is the README file for the FUNPSY (FUNctional magnetic resonant imaging Phase SYnchronization) 
toolbox, a MATLAB(TM) toolbox that uses phase synchronization to extract functional patterns from 
brain time series.

Since the paper explaining the novel method is under revision, the download is available only for 
few close collaborators. If you want to join us, please email enrico.glerean [at] aalto.fi.
