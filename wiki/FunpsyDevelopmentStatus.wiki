= Status of current development =

Added more atlases for connectivity analysis. Currently working on a function for group comparisons (i.e. is group A more in-synch than group B) and model based analysis (general linear model of time series of synchronization). 
A small "how to" has been added to wiki pages.

== Next in the pipeline ==

  * Parallel computing and optimizing permutation tests
  * Add more atlases for ROIs (UCLA, CC200 and CC400)

== Future ==
Python version of the code (send an email if you want to help!)
